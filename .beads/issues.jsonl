{"id":"wonderback-9","title":"Fix IssueSeverity enum import in ServerSettingsPoller","description":"ServerSettingsPoller imports IssueSeverity from model.AnalysisModels.kt, but AgentConfig.severityFilter uses its own IssueSeverity type. Need to verify these resolve to the same enum at compile time. If AgentConfig references a different IssueSeverity (e.g. from a different package), the poller's applySettings() will fail. Quick fix: ensure AgentConfig imports from the same AnalysisModels.kt, or have the poller use AgentConfig's type directly.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"noreply@anthropic.com","created_at":"2026-01-28T19:37:12.464144184Z","created_by":"Claude","updated_at":"2026-01-28T19:43:17.925791005Z","closed_at":"2026-01-28T19:43:17.925791005Z","close_reason":"Not a bug: AgentConfig and ServerSettingsPoller both use model.IssueSeverity. AgentConfig doesn't need an explicit import because it's in the same package. ServerSettingsPoller correctly imports com.google.android.accessibility.talkback.agent.model.IssueSeverity."}
